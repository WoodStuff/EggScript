# EggScript
A language I made because I felt like it. Built in C#.

## Features
- Recognizes strings and numbers
- Operators, including a string concatenation operator (yay!)
- Print keyword that prints stuff to the console
- Fully functional comments, both the // kind and the /* */ kind
- Mandatory semicolons, because I'm addicted to those

## Example program
```
print("hello"); // prints hello to the console
print(3 * 5) // multiply numbers together
print(0.1 + 0.2) // 0.30000000000000004, just like in any self-respecting language
// print(uncomment this line for an error)
```
